# Unhandled Error in Express.js POST Route

This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js applications where a POST route crashes due to unhandled errors when the request body is missing required fields.  The `bug.js` file shows the problematic code, while `bugSolution.js` provides a corrected version with comprehensive error handling.

## Problem

The original code lacks error handling for scenarios where the request body (`req.body`) is empty or missing expected properties. Attempting to access a property (e.g., `user.name`) of an undefined or incomplete object throws an error, causing the server to crash.

## Solution

The solution involves adding proper error handling.  This includes checking for the existence of required fields in the request body before accessing them.  If any required field is missing, an appropriate error response is sent to the client.
